                <p>
                    I taught myself programming and web development in college, and
                    decided to switch my major concentration to one that would allow me to
                    further my computer science knowledge. While I am comfortable
                    completing whatever tasks needed, I am happiest when working on
                    backend or general software engineering projects.
